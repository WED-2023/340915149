## About the Site
This website is a creative exploration of the dual personalities of the main character from "Fight Club." It features various sections (e.g. "About Me", "Photos", "Playlist") each reflecting the characteristics and tastes of the Narrator and Tyler Durden characters. Users can switch between these two personas by toggling the site's theme from light to dark.

### Light Theme: The Narrator
In the light theme, the website represents the Narrator's persona. It features a clean, light design reflecting his more controlled, albeit conflicted, nature. Each section in this theme provides insights into the Narrator's life, his thoughts, and his mundane existence before spiraling into chaos.

### Dark Theme: Tyler Durden
Switching to the dark theme unveils Tyler Durden's world. The design becomes darker, mirroring Tyler's anarchistic and vibrant personality. The content across the site changes to reflect Tyler's philosophies, his radical views, and his charismatic yet destructive nature.
